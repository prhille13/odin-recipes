    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>While breadsticks are often associated with Italian food, I can’t really think of a single recipe that wouldn’t be made better by a warm breadstick. Consider enjoying these with Chicken Cordon Bleu or Slow Cooker Creamy Ranch Pork Chops.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 cups warm water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>    
        <ol>
            <li>Add warm water, yeast and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer and stir gently. Rest for 5 minutes. The yeast should lightly foam on top. If it doesn't, the yeast may not be fresh. (If using Instant Yeast, skip this step and add the yeast, water and sugar with the rest of the ingredients).</li>
            <li>Add 1 ½ cups flour, salt and vegetable oil and mix on medium speed, to combine.</li>
            <li>Add another 1 ½ cups flour. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl but still be very slightly sticky to the touch. Add remaining ¼ cup of flour, only if needed. Knead mixture for 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a large, greased bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow to rest until double in size, about 1.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Once risen, punch dough down and divide it into 12 equal parts. Roll each piece of dough into a 9 inch rope and transfer to a greased cookie sheet. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise again for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Bake breadsticks at 425 degrees F for 10-12 minutes. Remove from oven, brush tops with butter and transfer to a wire cooling rack.</li>
            <li>Serve warm. Store in a airtight container, or in the freezer.</li>
        </ol>
